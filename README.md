## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create varaiables and how to create a font family.

```css
:root{
  --dark-magenta: hsl(300, 43%, 22%);
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "spartan400";
  src: url(static/LeagueSpartan-Regular.ttf);
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

### Continued development

I still wish to learn more about flexbox and grid, also, about Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja Flexbox Youtube Tutorial] - This helped me for learning about flexbox. I really liked this channel and I recommend that anyone who wishes to learn more checks it out too.
